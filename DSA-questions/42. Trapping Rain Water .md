## ⭐✔️Approach - 3  (in cpp)
```cpp
class Solution {
    /* ✔️⭐Approach - 3 (using preprocessing left and right logic)

        explanation :- acc to the preprocessing array logic, we will first find the for each building, the longest height on the left, and longest height on the right of it.
        then using formula :- 

            water at index i = min(left[i],right[i]) - height[i];

        ✅T : O(3*n) 
        S : O(2*n)

    */
public:
    // main 
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        
        int size = height.size();

        // preprocess array 'height' and for each element find the left longest element for it and store in 'left'
        vector<int> left(size);
        left[0] = height[0];
        for(int i=1; i < size; i++)
            left[i] = max(left[i-1],height[i]);
        
        // preprocess array 'height' and for each element find the right longest element for it and store in 'right'
        vector<int> right(size);
        right[size-1] = height[size-1];
        for(int i=size-2; i>=0; i--)
            right[i] = max(right[i+1],height[i]);
        
        
        // now find the water trapped on each index
        int totalWater = 0;
        for(int i=0; i < size; i++)
            totalWater += min(left[i],right[i]) - height[i];
        
        return totalWater;
    }

## ✔️Approach - 2  (hardcode but works)
```cpp
class Solution {

    /* ✔️⭐Approach - 2 (modified & optimised version of approach - 1)

        explanation :- 
                        step 1 : we will first use the 'https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/submission/1affabda582fc0e39345409b10ad47b5?user=yashasvcb6y%20%22' logic to find valid 'end' index for every 'start' 
                        step 2 : then we will map heights on right of each buildings to every ith building 
                        step 3 : at last when we have all the data we will find 'distace' 'heightsbetween' and at last we will find the water between every start and end region, and add it to 'totalWater'

    
     ✅T : O(3n) -> O(n) for filling 'startToEnd' , O(n) for filling 'heightsOnRight' , O(n) for main fun loop 
     ✅S : O(n) - 'startToEnd' vector, 'heightsOnRight' vector, stack 

        // ✔️\U0001f50dImp Observation :- one this i learned from this question is that if we create a node* 'prvNode' outside our for loop, as seen in seen, and then if we insert the this node into stack, then it will somewhere give error or wrong output, because we created this node outside the for loop and when and we are changing the value of it inside that loop, so basically our stack will loop like | x10 x10 x10 |
        where these 3 are just addresses pointing to same nodes, so its better to create the node inside the scope in which u are changing its value in that case as shown below every time we create prvNode, a new node is created, and which has nothing to do with previous prvNode created so stack will loop like | x10 x20 x30 |
