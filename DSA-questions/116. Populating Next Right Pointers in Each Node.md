        idea : we could have also do the inserting 'root' with 'null' logic to take care of each level individually as well, but this came to my mind first

        T :O(n)
        S :O(n) - queue

            Node* prv = q.front(); // using 2 nodes to connect all same level nodes
            Node* curr = nullptr;

            for(int i=0; i < size; i++){ // for nodes on same level

                curr = q.front(); // front becomes the new curr
                q.pop();

                prv -> next = curr; // conecting nodes at same level

                prv = curr; // prv updated 

                // inserting the childs of curr node (Front node) if any in queue
                if(curr -> left) q.push(curr -> left);
