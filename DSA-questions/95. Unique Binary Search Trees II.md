        idea : recursively using 'start' and 'end' values create all possible BSTs for 'leftSide' and all possible BSTS for 'rightSide'
               and ones we have them all, then left say leftVec has 2 BSTs and right also has 2 BSTs then 2*2 -> 4 so connect them and make 4 BSTs

                    1,2,3,4,....(i).....n

                    root =  (i)
                           /   \
           [BSTs with nodes    [BSTs with nodes from i+1 to n]
            from 1 to i-1]


        T : O(n) - n nodes will be build recursively
        S : O(n) - recursive

private:
    vector<TreeNode*> buildBST(int start, int end){// this fun created BSTs with nodes in given range and stores their roots in vec and returns then
    
        // base case- when reached out of range, return null BST
        if(start > end) return {nullptr};


        vector<TreeNode*> ans; // insert all bsts considering 'start' to 'end' nodes as the root into this 'ans'

        // from node 'start' to 'end' 1 by 1 consider each one as root, then create BSTs
        for(int i=start; i <= end; i++){
