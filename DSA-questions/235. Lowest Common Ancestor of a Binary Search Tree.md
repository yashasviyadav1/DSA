note : Approach - 2,3 is faster

##✔️⭐⭐ Approach - 3 (shortest and fastest)
```java
/* ✔️⭐⭐Approach - 2 [in java] (recursive & better )

    idea - if both p,q are smaller then root that means LCA lies only in leftSubtree
           else if both q,q are greater then root then LCA lies in right subtree only
           else if one of p and q is smaller then root and other is larger then root that means we are on LCA node

    T : O(log*n)
    S : O(n) - recrusive

*/


class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) // both p,q are smalller then root, search for LCA in left subtree
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        else if(p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val)// p,q are larger then root, search for LCA in right subtree
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        else return root; // here root is larger then 1 node and smaller then the other so, root is our LCA 
    }
}
```
## Approach - 1 
```cpp

/*✔️⭐ Approach - 1 (recursion)
    
    idea : recursively find p, q nodes in left and right subtrees, and the least node where both p, 1 are found that is the LCA 
    
    T : O(n)
    S : O(n) - recursive only

*/
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {

        // base cases - i) for a null tree, LCA is null   ii) every node is LCA of itself
        if(!root) return nullptr;
        if(root == p || root == q) return root;

        // recrusively find the LCA of left and right subtree
        TreeNode* leftLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root -> left, p, q);
        TreeNode* rightLCA = lowestCommonAncestor(root -> right, p, q);

        if(leftLCA && rightLCA) return root; // if p and q was found each in both subtrees that means currently we are on LCA node
        
        // if 1 side's lca is null, and others lca is non null, return non null 
        if(leftLCA && !(rightLCA)) return leftLCA;
        else if(rightLCA && !(leftLCA)) return rightLCA;

        return nullptr; // p, q was not found
        
    }
};
```

### Approach - 2
since it is a bst, so left subtree has nodes smaller then root, and right subtree has nodes greater then the root
```cpp
/* ✔️⭐⭐Approach - 2 (recursive & better )

    idea - if both p,q are smaller then root that means LCA lies only in leftSubtree
           else if both q,q are greater then root then LCA lies in right subtree only
           else if one of p and q is smaller then root and other is larger then root that means we are on LCA node

    T : O(log*n)
    S : O(n) - recrusive

*/

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {

        if(!root) return nullptr;
        if(p -> val < root -> val && q -> val < root -> val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root -> left, p, q);
        else if(p -> val > root -> val && q -> val > root -> val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root -> right, p, q);
        else return root;
        
    }
};
```
