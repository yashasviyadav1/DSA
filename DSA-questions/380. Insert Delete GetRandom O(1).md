# 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

note : the `remove()` part is imp in this code

## ✔️Approach - 1 (using hashmap and arrayList)
```java
// Approach - 1
// using a 'arrayList' to store elements and a 'hashmap' to map thoose elements with their index (of arr
// we are maintaining this hashmap coz when we want to insert a element we have to check if it is already present
// so to check this we can't do it in array we need to map elements to index so we check that in hashmap
// T:O(1) for all operations,   S:O(n) for hashmap,arr  n is no of operations/commands given

class RandomizedSet {
    ArrayList<Integer> arr;
    Map<Integer,Integer> hm; // mapping ele to its index where it is stored in arr
    public RandomizedSet() {
        arr = new ArrayList<>();
        hm = new HashMap<>();
    }
    
    public boolean insert(int val) {
        if(hm.containsKey(val) == true) return false; // already present can't insert
        else{
            // insert no at end of arr and save its index in the hashmap
            arr.add(val); // inserting at end of array means at index = size-1 
            hm.put(val, arr.size()-1); //mapping ele to index
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    public boolean remove(int val) {
        // imp
        // we need to delete the 'val' from array so we can get index of this element and then remove this element from array using arr.remove(index)
        // then ones that 'val' is removed from array each element will have their index shifted to left
        // and in map we have the old index so we can't do this at all
        // so what we do rather is we want to remove 'val' such that all other elements are not displaced
        // so we copy the 'last element' of array at place of 'val' and then remove the last element of that array
        // make sure to update the lastElement's index in the map 
        // and make sure to delete the entry of 'val' from the map
        if(hm.containsKey(val) == true){ 
            // edge case : removing the only element left in array : is handled here
            // how ? coz if arr = {5} replaced 5 with 5 new array = {5} and entry in hm is updated and then same entry is deleted 
            int ind = hm.get(val); // val is present at ind so we need to remove it
            int lastElement = arr.get(arr.size()-1); // pick last ele and copy it at the 'ind', and then delete the last element, this way 'val' is deleted from the arr 
            arr.set(ind, lastElement);
            hm.put(lastElement, ind);
            arr.remove(arr.size()-1); 
            hm.remove(val);
            return true;
        }
        else return false; // element not in array so can't be removed
    }
    
    public int getRandom() {
        // getting random index in range [0 to n-1]
        // Math.random() returns no between 0.0 to 9.9 so if we multiply this with 7 then we get a random no in range 0 to 6
        // so to get random index in range 0 to n-1 multiply it with n 
        int n = arr.size(); 
        int randomIndex = (int)(Math.random() * n);
        return arr.get(randomIndex);
    }
