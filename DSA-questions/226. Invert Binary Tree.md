# 226. Invert Binary Tree

#### [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree)

### Approach - 1 (recursive)
```java
// to invert a tree we need to invert its original right and store it in its left and invert its original left and store it into its right
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return null;
        TreeNode invertedLeft = invertTree(root.left);
        TreeNode invertedRight = invertTree(root.right);
        root.left = invertedRight;
        root.right = invertedLeft;
        return root;
    }
}
```

OR 

```java
// to invert a tree we need to invert its original right and store it in its left and invert its original left and store it into its right
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return null;
        TreeNode invertedLeft = invertTree(root.left);
        root.left = invertTree(root.right);
        root.right = invertedLeft;
        return root;
    }
}
```
