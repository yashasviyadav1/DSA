# 134. Gas Station

### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

## ✔️Approach - 3 (most optimal and concise)
```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {

        // Approach - 3 
        // maintaining 'totalSurplus' and 'localSurplus'
        // Time : O(n) Space : O(1)
        
        int n = gas.length;
        int totalSurplus = 0; // maintains total gas - cost till particular i
        int surplus = 0; // maintains gas - cost (from a particular start till i)
        int start = 0;
        for(int i=0; i < n; i++){
            totalSurplus += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            surplus += (gas[i] - cost[i]);
            if(surplus < 0){ // we started from 'start' and till i if we ran out of fuel, start from next point
                start = i + 1;
                surplus = 0; // reset the local surplus when we have a new start 
            }
        }
        return (totalSurplus < 0)? -1 : start; // we visited all stations and after the end if we have gas in non neg (gas >= 0) means we did not ran out of fuel so return the start 
    }
}

## ✔️Approach - 2 (improved bruteforce)
```java
class Solution {
    // T:O(n) S:O(1) - improved bruteforce

        idea : we maintain a 'start' and a 'j' index variables, now we consider each point as start and move j and whever j reaches start again that means we got our answer, but there are few things we will take care of to improve the time complexity
            
            1) eliminating the repeatitive work
                       A B C D
                gas = {5,2,1,2}
               cost = {4,2,3,2}

               observation, if starting from A we can only reach till C and not reach D that means that all points between the start and failed point (D) i.e B,C,D also can not reach D so we do not need to check them in the loop, so what we do is whever we reach a failed index, next time we start from the failed index itself (D) and not the middle ones

            2) avoiding infinite loop of 'start' 

                in some cases start variable can go in a infinite loop
                eg : gas = [3,1,1]  cost = [1,2,2]
                
                to avaoid it we use a condition that lets say we have points A B C D E F G,  now if we have start = D that means we already check for A,B,C and they can't be the starting point, and starting from D if we failed at a point E that means we can still find our ans as point F,G (right of failed point), but if starting from D we failed at B (left of start) then that means we check all points of the array from A to G and we got no answer so return -1

            // reached here means we could not reach the 'start' rather we stuck at some point j
            // so start 'start' from j now i.e the failed point
            if(j < start) break;// failed point is at left of start point means but we have already checked all points on left of start so means we can never find a valid start  
            start = j+1;  // imp: we can not start from j never coz we can never start from a failed point we will be stuck

## Approach - 1 (modified)
```cpp

class Solution {
/* ✔️⭐Approach -1 (modified approach -1)

     idea : we consider index 0 as the starting point and go on to the station wheree we fail to reach, now if we failed at a point 'x' which is on right of the starting point 's'. so lets say start=3 , and we failed to reach '7' then if we can not reach 7 starting from 3 then how can we reach 7 starting from 4,5,6 so to reduce the time, we consider new start as the prv failed point i.e 7, and start the algorithm again, now just make sure for cases like :  gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3], here we can be trapped into a infinite time case, because we need to take care of one more thing :- 

            station : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
        lets say starting from station '5' , we know that 1,2,3,4 can not be the starting point, so if stating from 5 we failed at station 3(on left of 'start') then that means including '5'(start) all points on right of start are useless also, so we know that no answer exists.
