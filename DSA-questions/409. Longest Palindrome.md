# 409. Longest Palindrome

#### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/description)

### Approach - 1 
```cpp
class Solution {

/*‚≠ê Approach - 1 (by finding freq of each char)
    // idea : see, lets say we have string 'abccccdd' now in a palindrome, each char has to occur twice (except for 1 char if the palindrome is of odd length), so find out the freq of each char, now if freq of a char 'c' is even then we can add all char to the palindrome, but a only 1 char can have single occurrence
     T : O(n)
     S : O(n)

        for(int i=0; i < s.length(); i++) // map char to its freq 
            charToFreq[s[i]]++;

        bool singleCharOccurred = false;
        int palinLen = 0;

            char ch = block.first;
            int freq = block.second;

            // if char has even freq means add all occurrence of this char to palindrome
            // else if char freq is odd then add all char to palin (if singleCharOcc is false), else sub 1 and add
            if(freq % 2 == 0)
