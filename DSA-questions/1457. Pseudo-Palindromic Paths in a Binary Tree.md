## Approach - 1 (DFS + conditions)
```java

/* ✔️⭐Approach -1 (DFS)

    idea : for each node we are counting its occurence or frequency, first we increment the freq of each node and as soon as we reach the leaf we check if with these current freq of each node on current path is it possible to make a palindrome, how do we check this? in a palindrome there can be either odd len or even len palin 
        eg. 1 2 3 4 3 2 1  (odd length)
        eg. 1 2 3 2 1  (even length)
    if all elements are of even freq that is each element is occureing even no of times, then it can definitly make a palindrome
    if no of elements occuring odd no of times <= 1 then only it can be a palin eg. 1 2 3 2 1 (3 occuring 1 time rest all occuring even times) and 1 1 1 (here to only 1 element is occuring odd times)
 
    Time : O(n * 9)) -> O(n)
    Space : O(n) - rec
