# 198. House Robber

### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)

## ⭐✔️ Approach - 3 (bottom up tabulation)
tabulation + space optimisation :-
```java
class Solution {
/* ✔️⭐Approach - 2.1 (Tabulation + space optimisation)
        concept - to find max money we can rob till last house, we should know max money we can rob for its prev 2 houses as well
    Time O(n) 
    Space O(1)
*/

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return nums[0];

        // Tabulation + space optimisation
        // since for any i we need ans for its prev 2 houses, so replace dp with 2 variables
        int n = nums.length;
        // prev2, prev1, curr
        int prev2 = nums[0]; // 2nd neigh
        int prev1 = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]); // just neigh

        for(int i=2; i < n; i++){ // we already have ans for 0,1 house so lets start from 2
            
            int curr = Math.max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i]);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }
        return prev1 ; // we need to find max money looted till last house

    }
}
```
normal tabulation : -
```java
class Solution {
/* ✔️⭐Approach - 2 (bottom up tabulation)
        concept - to find max money we can rob till last house, we should know max money we can rob for its prev 2 houses as well
    Time O(n) 
    Space O(n) - no rec stack req
*/

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 1) return nums[0];
        
        // Tabulation
        // step1 : set base cases to dp
        // step2 : during rec we started from n-1 to 0, so reverse that for tabulation
        // step3 : replace func call with dp
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];  
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);

        for(int i=2; i < n; i++) // we already have ans for 0,1 house so lets start from 2
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], dp[i - 2] + nums[i]);
             
        return dp[n-1]; // we need to find max money looted till last house

    }
}
```

## ✔️⭐ Approach - 2 (recursive bruteforce - based on choices + DP)🪄
concept :- 
```cpp
 if we have singe house, the only amount we can rob is that itself
 if we have 2 houses only, we can only loop single house (whichever has more money)
 since we can not loot adjacent houses so to find max money loted till indexth house we have to find max money for its prev to houses
 prev2 , prev1,  curr (houses) 
     if we  have looted x amount till prev2 to, then till curr we can loop x + curr
     if we looted x amount till prev1 then we can not loot the curr house, that itself becomes our max money
```
java code :- 
```java
class Solution {
/* ✔️⭐Approach - 1 (bruteforce fibo type + top down dp)
    concept - to find max money we can rob till last house, we should know max money we can rob for its prev 2 houses as well
    Time O(n) 
    Space O(n)
*/
    private int maxMoneyRobbedTill(int[] nums, int[] dp, int index){ 
        // if we have singe house, the only amount we can rob is that itself
        // if we have 2 houses only, we can only loop single house (whichever has more money)
        if(dp[index] != -1) return dp[index];
        if(index == 0) return nums[0];
        if(index == 1) return Math.max(nums[1], nums[0]);

        return dp[index] = Math.max(maxMoneyRobbedTill(nums, dp, index-1), maxMoneyRobbedTill(nums, dp, index - 2) + nums[index]);
    }

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        
        int lastHouseIndex = nums.length - 1;
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length]; // since we need to know the max money till last index only (0 -> n-1 is n elements)
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        return maxMoneyRobbedTill(nums, dp, lastHouseIndex); // max money lotted till last house 
    }
}
```
cpp code :- 
```cpp
class Solution {
    /*✔️⭐ Approach - 2 (recursive bruteforce - based on choices + DP🪄)

            idea : to find the maximum money that can be robbed, what we can do is we have 2 choices :- 
                        
                     i) if we robbed the current 'i'th house -> the total money robbed will be = maxMoneyRobbedTill(i-2th house) + current house money  // because we can not rob adjacent houses
                    
                     ii) we did not rob the current ith house -> then the total money robbed till now  = maxMoneyRobbedTill(i-1) house that is // as it is as prv of current house

                - every time we calculate max money robbed till current house, store it in dp 
                - do not calculate value for same house again 
                
        T : O(2^n) - 2 choices at each house
