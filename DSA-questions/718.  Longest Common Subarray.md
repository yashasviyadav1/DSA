# 718. Longest Common Subarray / Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray

#### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-repeated-subarray/)
prerequisite : longest common subseq 

## Approach - 1 (tabulation - bottom up dp)
first finding Length of longest common subarray then printing the subarray :-
```java
class Solution {
/* ✔️Approach - 1 (bottom up dp)
     idea : see in the longest common subseq question we can break any string and fix the other string
                but here we need to find subsrting or subarray (which is consecutive) and can not break, so only change is that when we we find 2 elements at i and j are not common so the long common substring/subarray len is 0, we cant break and fix the string
                and when we have 2 common elements at i and j of 2 arrays that means we inc len of substring by 1 and move both pointers simultaneously to find rem ans 
    note : this que is same as longest common substring question
    Time:O(n*m)
    Space:O(n*m) - dp
