```cpp

class Solution {
    /* ⭐✔️Approach - 1 (recursive)

            explanation : when reached end(null) then return, and if reached leaf then add this leaf to currSUm and then check if our currSum == target, if yes, then store the leaf to the currPath, and then store this path into all paths 'ans' and return (make sure to backtrack before returning)
                         
        Time : O(n)
        Space : O(n) - only recursive

        // base case - if reached leaf node, compare sum with targetSum if it equals then push currPath into the ans
