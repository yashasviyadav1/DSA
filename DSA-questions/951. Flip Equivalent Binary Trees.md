note here 2's child are not flipped 


### Approach - 1 (recursive)
```java
// difference betwwen inverted tree and flipped tree is that in inverted tree whole tree has to be flipped from root to leaf everything flips (like mirror image) whereas flipped tree may have some or all parts flipped. so we will have 2 check for 2 ways in this question
//that 2 trees can be flipped equivalent if(1's left == 2's left AND 1's right == 2's right) this is when childs are not flipped, OR if(1's left == 2's right AND 1'right == 2's left) this is when childs are flipped .

class Solution {
    public boolean flipEquiv(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if(root1 == null && root2 == null) return true;
        else if(root1 == null || root2 == null) return false;
        if(root1.val == root2.val){
            return ( flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.left) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.right) ||
                        flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.right) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.left));
        }
        else return false;
    }
}
```
