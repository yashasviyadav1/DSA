# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence 

#### Solved at [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/description/)
prerequisite : Longest Common subseq

Concept : 
```
notes:
   we need to find the shortest common superseq that has both str1 and str2 as subseq 
   so the longest common subseq(i.e common chars) of str1 and str2 will be taken in superSeq only ones
   and the non common char of both str1 and str2 will also be picked
   we need to find out longCommSubseq LCS dp and using that we will find the shortest common superseq
   after we have dp we will start from end and when both chars are same(we pick them ones in superSeq)
   else if both chars are not same (non common chars) so menas our lcs ans has come from either top cell or left cell
   so move to maximum ans cell but before moving to top add the ith cell to sup before cutting it off and before moving to left add the jth cell before cutting it off

## ✔️Approach - 1 (Bottom up dp - tabulation)
```java
class Solution {
    // Approach - 1 (bottom up dp - tabulation)
    // prereq : longest common subseq 
    // Time : O(n*m + n*m) -> O(n*m)
    // Space : O(n*m) -> dp
    public String shortestCommonSupersequence(String str1, String str2) {

        
        int n = str1.length(), m = str2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1]; //fill dp table for lcs
        
        for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j=1; j <= m; j++){
                if(str1.charAt(i-1) == str2.charAt(j-1))
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
                else dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]); 
            }
        }

        // so finding out shortestCommonSupperSeq (supSeq), add char at start of it since we are traversing in rev
        int i=n, j=m;
        String supSeq = "";
        while(i > 0 && j > 0){ // go on while both str are not empty
            if(str1.charAt(i-1) == str2.charAt(j-1)){ // common char is picked only 1s in superSeq, move diagonally up
                supSeq = str1.charAt(i-1) + supSeq;
                i--;
                j--;
            }
            else{// non common char found, means our lcs ans has come from either upper cell or left cell, go to whatever is max
                if(dp[i-1][j] > dp[i][j-1]){ // move to upper cell, before moving add ith char to sup
                    supSeq = str1.charAt(i-1) + supSeq;
                    i--;
                }
                else{ // left cell is greater then upper, so add jth cell to ans and move to left 
                    supSeq = str2.charAt(j-1) + supSeq;
                    j--;
                }
            }
        }

        // for case when one of the strings became empty, then supSeq will be the other string complete
        while(i > 0){
            supSeq = str1.charAt(i-1) + supSeq;
            i--;
        }
        while(j > 0){
            supSeq = str2.charAt(j-1) + supSeq;
            j--;

        return supSeq;
