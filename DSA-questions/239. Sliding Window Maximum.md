# 239. Sliding Window Maximum

#### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

How do we insert in dq ??
```
First of all we are maintaining dq such that at any point of time it stores the
-> largest element of the window on the First of the queue
-> and on its right will be other elements in dec order which will be helpful later

eg. {3, 5, 1, 6, 8}  k=3
     -------

ele = 3
------------------------
  3 
-----------------------

ele = 5   (since in window 5 is greater then 3 and also 3 is on left in window to the 5 so 3 becomes of no use even later on coz window shifts to right later so 5 will be more imp
-----------------------
 5 
-----------------------

ele = 1   (since 5 is greater then 1, so 5 remains as it is 1 goes to the end of q why?? coz after the window shifts the next greater element candidate can be 1
-----------------------
5  1 
-----------------------

so to insert a ele we pop window from end to find a place for element where all its left are greater then it

and when we shift the window left++ then we make sure if the left element of window is front of q then we remove it (note that if left element is in q the only place it can be is on leftmost of queue)
because we are inserting elements at end of q so q is maintaining order of elements in the q  
```

## ✔️Approach - 1 (Using doubly ended queue)
```java
// bruteforce T:O(n*k) Space : O(n)
// using deque 
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n - k + 1];
        int index = 0;
        Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int left = 0;
        
        for(int right = 0; right < n; right++){

            int ele = nums[right];
            // we need to place this in q such that greatest ele of window is on start of dq and, some other elements on the left
            // pop elements from end while the elements are lesser then ele
            while(!dq.isEmpty() && dq.getLast() < ele)
                dq.removeLast();
            
            dq.addLast(ele);

            // window is of size k now
            if(right >= k - 1){
                ans[index++] = dq.getFirst();// largest ele of window
                if(nums[left] == dq.getFirst()) // shifting the window from left so remove left is its in q
                    dq.removeFirst();
                left++;
            }
        }

        return ans;

    }
}
```

## [TLE] Approach - 0 (Using bruteforce)
```java
// bruteforce T:O(n*k) Space : O(1)
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n - k + 1];
        int index = 0;
        for(int i=0; i <= n - k; i++){
            int maxEle = (int)-1e9;
            for(int j=i; j < i + k; j++){
                maxEle = Math.max(maxEle, nums[j]);
            }
            ans[index++] = maxEle;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
