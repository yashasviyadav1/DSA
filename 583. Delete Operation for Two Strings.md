# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings / Minimum Insertions or Deletions to Convert String A to String B

### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/)
### Prerequisite : Longest Common Subseq

#### Concept 
![Flow - Frame 4](https://github.com/yashasviyadav1/dsa-questions/assets/124666305/621d707b-7a6d-4a75-8342-642a9d0462a3)

 we have 2 strings `s1="s e a m o p d q"` and `s2="s m n o q"` now we need to find the min deletion req in both strings such that both s1 and s2 becomes same
 so observe that we can only delete the non common characters in order to make the both strings same
 so if we find the common chars (in same order) in both the strings then the remaining chars are the ones that we can delete
 so to find the common chars in order we need to find the length of longest common subseq in s1 and s2 
 then count of nonCommon ones to be `min deleted/inserted = s1.len() + s2.length() - 2*longCommonSubseq's length   `


## ✔️Approach - 4 (Space optimization)
```java
class Solution {
    // Approach -4 (space optimization)
    // prereq -> LongCommonSuseq question
    // Time : O(n*m) Space : O(2*m) - dp 

    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
         
        
        // lcs code
        // tabulation to space optimization
        int n = word1.length(), m = word2.length();
        int[] prev = new int[m+1]; // index shifted so +1
        
        //base - aleast 1 string empty, len of lcs is 0
        for(int i=1; i <= n; i++) prev[0] = 0; 
        for(int j=1; j <= m; j++) prev[j] = 0; 

        for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){
            int[] curr = new int[m+1];
            for(int j=1; j <= m; j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))
                    curr[j] = 1 + prev[j-1];
                else curr[j] = 0 + Math.max(curr[j-1], prev[j]);
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
        int longCommonSubseqLen = prev[m];
        
        return word1.length() + word2.length() - 2*longCommonSubseqLen;//min del req in both strings to make s1==s2
    }
}
```

## ✔️Approach - 3 (bottom up dp - tabulation)
```java
class Solution {
    // Approach -3 (bottom up dp - tabulation)
    // prereq -> LongCommonSuseq question
    // Time : O(n*m) Space : O(n*m) - dp 

    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        // lcs code
        // memoization to tabulation
        int n = word1.length(), m = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1]; // index shifted so +1
        
        //base - aleast 1 string empty, len of lcs is 0
        for(int i=1; i <= n; i++) dp[i][0] = 0; 
        for(int j=1; j <= m; j++) dp[0][j] = 0; 

        for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){
            for(int j=1; j <= m; j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
                else dp[i][j] = 0 + Math.max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j]);
            }
        }
        int longCommonSubseqLen = dp[n][m];
        
        return word1.length() + word2.length() - 2*longCommonSubseqLen;//min del req in both strings to make s1==s2
    }
}
```

## ✔️Approach - 2 (top down dp - memoization)
```java
class Solution {
    // Approach -2 (top down dp - memoization)
    // prereq -> LongCommonSuseq question
    // Time : O(n*m) Space : O(n*m) - dp,rec

    //len of longest Common subseq code (i means index for word1, j for word2)
    private int solve(String word1, String word2, int[][] dp, int i, int j){
        
        if(i == 0 || j == 0) return 0; 
        if(dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j]; 

        if(word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))// common char found, lcs len inc by 1
            return dp[i][j] = 1 + solve(word1, word2,dp, i-1, j-1); 
        else return dp[i][j] = 0 + Math.max(solve(word1, word2,dp, i-1,j), 
                                                solve(word1, word2, dp, i, j-1));
    }
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length(), m = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1]; // index shifted so +1
        for(int[] row:dp) Arrays.fill(row, -1);

        int longCommonSubseqLen = solve(word1, word2, dp, n, m);//started from n so before accesing index of org string do -1 

        return word1.length() + word2.length() - 2*longCommonSubseqLen;
    }
}
```

## [TLE⚠️] Approach - 1 (bruteforce)
```java
class Solution {
    // Approach -1 (brutefroce)
    // prereq -> LongCommonSuseq question
    // Time : O(2^n*2^m) Space : O(n*m)
    //len of longest Common subseq code
    private int solve(String word1, String word2, int i, int j){
        if(i == 0 || j == 0) return 0; 
        if(word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))// common char found, lcs len inc by 1
            return 1 + solve(word1, word2, i-1, j-1); 
        else return 0 + Math.max(solve(word1, word2, i-1,j), solve(word1, word2, i, j-1));
    }
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        
        // we have 2 strings s1="s e a m o p d q" and s2="s m n o q" now we need to find the min deletion req in both strings such that both s1 and s2 becomes same
        // so observe that we can only delete the non common characters in order to make the both strings same
        // so if we find the common chars (in same order) in both the strings then the remaining chars are the ones that we can delete
        // so to find the common chars in order we need to find the length of longest common subseq in s1 and s2 
        // then count of nonCommon ones to be deleted = s1.len() + s2.length() - 2*longCommonSubseq's length    
        int n = word1.length(), m = word2.length();
        int longCommonSubseqLen = solve(word1, word2, n, m);

        return word1.length() + word2.length() - 2*longCommonSubseqLen;
    }
}
