### Compulsory Question

**Q1 (i): Discuss the impact of choosing a research problem that is too broad or too narrow. (4 marks)**

**Answer (i)**

Choosing the right "scope" is critical. If the scope is wrong, the research fails before it starts.

**1. Impact of a Problem being Too Broad (Vague)**

- **Superficial Analysis:** The researcher tries to cover too many variables, leading to a shallow study. You become a "Jack of all trades, master of none."
- **Time & Resource Drain:** It becomes impossible to collect data or simulate all scenarios within the M.Tech timeline (6-12 months).
- **Lack of Conclusion:** The research wanders aimlessly without a clear stopping point.
- *Example:* "Improving Cyber Security." (This is impossible to solve in one thesis. It covers Network, Web, Cloud, IoT, etc.)

**2. Impact of a Problem being Too Narrow (Trivial)**

- **Limited Significance:** The findings are so specific that they don't help the scientific community.
- **Generalization Failure:** Results cannot be applied to other scenarios.
- **Publication Issues:** Journals often reject such papers for lacking "substantial contribution."
- *Example:* "Analyzing Wi-Fi signal strength in the University Canteen." (This is just a site survey, not research.)
**Conclusion:** A researcher must delimit the scope (e.g., "Improving DDoS detection in SDN networks using Deep Learning").

**Q1 (ii): How can a researcher address critical feedback constructively to improve their proposal? (4 marks)**

**Answer 1(ii)**

Feedback from supervisors or a review committee (DRC) is not an attack; it is a quality control mechanism.

**1. Separate Tone from Content**

- Reviewers might be harsh. The researcher must ignore the "tone" and focus on the "technical validity" of the comment.

**2. Categorization of Feedback**

- **Valid Errors:** Factual mistakes or missing logic. *Action: Correct immediately.*
- **Scope Issues:** Suggestions to add/remove topics. *Action: Negotiate based on time constraints.*
- **Clarifications:** If the reviewer didn't understand, the writing is likely unclear. *Action: Rewrite for clarity.*

**3. Iterative Refinement**

- Use the feedback to tighten the "Problem Statement" and "Methodology." If they question the feasibility of an algorithm, run a small pilot test (proof of concept) to prove it works.

**4. The "Response Sheet" Approach**

- When resubmitting, create a table showing "Comment $\rightarrow$ Action Taken." This shows professionalism and ensures no point was missed.

**Q1 (iii): Discuss the challenges inventors face during the patenting process and how they can be addressed. (3 marks)**

**Answer 1.(iii)**

**Challenge 1: Novelty / Prior Art**

*The Issue:* The Patent Office rejects the application because a similar invention already exists (Prior Art).

- *How to Address:* Conduct a rigorous **Patent Search** (using Google Patents/Espacenet) *before* filing to ensure the idea is unique.

**Challenge 2: High Costs & Complexity**

- *The Issue:* Drafting claims requires "Legalese" (legal language), and filing fees + attorney fees are high.
- *How to Address:* Use schemes like **SIPP (Start-ups Intellectual Property Protection)** for fee rebates (80% off) or file a "Provisional Application" first (cheaper) to secure the date.

**Challenge 3: Objections (FER)**

- *The Issue:* The examiner raises technical objections in the First Examination Report (FER).
- *How to Address:* Reply specifically to each objection within 6 months with technical proof or amend the claims to differentiate from cited prior art.

**Q1 (iv): How does the transfer of technology benefit both patent holders and licensees? (4 marks)**

**Answer (iv)**

**Technology Transfer** is the movement of IP from the creator (Lab/University) to the market (Industry).

**1. Benefits for Patent Holders (Licensor)**

- **Revenue Generation:** They earn **Royalties** (e.g., 5% of sales) without having to manufacture or sell the product themselves.
- **Risk Mitigation:** They avoid the financial risk of setting up factories, supply chains, and marketing teams.
- **Focus on Core Competency:** A university or R&D lab can focus on *inventing* while the company handles *business*.

**2. Benefits for Licensees (The Company buying the tech)**

- **Reduced R&D Costs:** It is cheaper to buy a proven solution than to invent it from scratch.
- **Faster Time-to-Market:** They can launch the product immediately since the technology is already developed.
- **Competitive Advantage:** They get exclusive rights to a cutting-edge technology that their competitors don't have.
- *Example:* A University develops a new Image Compression algorithm (Patent Holder). Adobe (Licensee) pays them to use it in Photoshop. The University gets money; Adobe gets a faster product. Win-Win.

### Unit-1

**Q2 (a): What are the primary sources for identifying a research problem? Provide examples from various fields of study. (9 Marks)**

**Answer 2.(a):**

**Introduction:**
Finding a "good" research problem is often the most difficult step in the research process. A research problem is rarely "invented"; usually, it is "discovered" from specific sources. These sources can be broadly categorized into academic (theoretical) sources and practical (empirical) sources.

Here are the primary sources for identifying a research problem:

**1. Critical Literature Review (The Most Common Source)**

- **Description:** This involves reading existing books, journals, and conference papers. Researchers look for "Gaps"—areas that previous researchers have missed, ignored, or failed to solve. They also look for the "Future Scope" section in papers.
- **Example (CSE):** A student reads a paper on "Data Encryption in Cloud." The author mentions that the algorithm works well for text but is slow for video. *The Problem Identified:* "Optimizing Encryption Algorithms for Real-Time Video Streaming."
- **Example (Medical):** A review of studies shows that a specific heart medicine works for men but has unstudied side effects on women. *The Problem:* "Gender-specific side effects of Drug X."

**2. Personal Experience and Professional Practice**

- **Description:** Daily observations in a workplace or academic environment often reveal inefficiencies or difficulties that need solving.
- **Example (Education):** A teacher notices that students learn better when using visual aids compared to text-only books. *The Problem:* "Impact of Visual Learning Tools on Student Retention Rates."
- **Example (CSE/IT):** A software engineer notices that the company's server crashes every time traffic spikes by 20%. *The Problem:* "Dynamic Load Balancing Strategies for High-Traffic Servers."

**3. Social and Technological Trends**

- **Description:** New changes in society or technology introduce new problems that didn't exist before.
- **Example (Sociology):** The rise of social media has created issues like cyberbullying. *The Problem:* "Psychological Effects of Cyberbullying on Teenagers."
- **Example (CSE):** The introduction of 5G technology brings new security risks. *The Problem:* "Security Protocols for 5G-enabled IoT Devices."

**4. Inconsistencies in Theories**

- **Description:** Sometimes, two existing theories contradict each other, or a theory does not match real-world observations. Investigating this conflict is a strong source of research.
- **Example (Physics/General):** Theory A suggests that "Project X" should succeed, but in practice, it fails. Investigating *why* it fails is the research problem.

**5. Interdisciplinary Intersection**

- **Description:** Applying a concept from one field to another often solves complex problems.
- **Example (Bio-Informatics):** Using biological concepts (like Neural Networks in brains) to solve computer science problems (Artificial Neural Networks).

**Q2 (b): What are some common errors researchers make when selecting a research problem? Provide examples. (6 Marks)**

**Answer 2(b).:**

Selecting a poor problem can doom a research project before it even begins. The following are common errors to avoid:

**1. Subject is Too Broad (Over-ambitious)**

- **The Error:** The researcher chooses a topic that covers too many variables, making it impossible to study in depth.
- **Example:** "Studying Artificial Intelligence." (This is a field, not a problem. It includes robotics, NLP, vision, etc.)
    - *Correction:* "Studying the accuracy of NLP models in detecting Hindi dialect slang."

**2. Subject is Too Narrow (Trivial)**

- **The Error:** The scope is so small that the findings do not contribute anything significant to the field.
- **Example:** "Analysis of Wi-Fi speed in Room 304 of the Computer Block." (The results are useless to anyone outside that room.)

**3. Unavailability of Data**

- **The Error:** Choosing a fascinating problem but realizing later that the data required is confidential, expensive, or impossible to get.
- **Example:** "Analyzing the internal security protocols of the Indian Army." (You will never get permission to access this data.)

**4. Subject is Overdone (Lack of Novelty)**

- **The Error:** Picking a topic that has been exhausted by previous researchers. It is difficult to throw new light on it.
- **Example:** "Comparing Bubble Sort vs. Quick Sort." (This is a textbook fact, not a research problem.)

**5. Ethical Violations**

- **The Error:** Formulating a problem that requires unethical behavior, such as invading privacy or harming subjects.
- **Example:** "Creating a virus to test how fast it destroys a banking network." (This is illegal and unethical.)

**6. Lack of Technical Competence**

- **The Error:** Choosing a problem that requires skills the researcher does not possess and cannot learn in time.
- **Example:** A Web Developer choosing a thesis on "Quantum Cryptography Physics" without a background in Quantum Mechanics.

***Question-3: What do you mean by interpretation? Why is it considered a basic component of research process? Discuss the precautions that the researcher should take while interpreting his / her findings.***

**1. Meaning of Interpretation**

Interpretation is the core of the research process that gives "meaning" to the collected data. After the data has been collected and analyzed (statistical calculations, graphs, etc.), it is still just raw numbers or facts. **Interpretation is the act of drawing inferences and conclusions from these analyzed facts.**

It acts as a bridge between the **results of the study** and the **research problem**. It answers the "So What?" question—explaining why the findings matter and how they relate to existing theories or practical applications.

- **Technically:** It is the search for broader meaning of research findings.
- **Functionally:** It is the transition from "Data Analysis" (What does the data say?) to "Conclusion" (What does it mean?).

**2. Why is Interpretation a Basic Component of the Research Process?**

Interpretation is not just an optional final step; it is fundamental to the scientific method for the following reasons:

**a) It Establishes the "Usefulness" of the Study**
Raw data (e.g., "CPU usage is 40%") is useless on its own. Interpretation converts this into actionable knowledge (e.g., "The algorithm is efficient enough for mobile devices"). Without interpretation, research is just data hoarding.

**b) It Leads to Generalization**
Research is usually done on a small sample (e.g., testing a protocol on 50 nodes). Interpretation allows the researcher to **generalize** these findings to the whole population (e.g., "This protocol will work for all large-scale networks"). This process of inductive reasoning happens only during interpretation.

**c) It Connects Findings to Theory**
Interpretation allows the researcher to compare their results with existing studies. It confirms whether the hypothesis was correct or if existing theories need to be modified. It anchors the new research within the existing body of knowledge.

**d) It Triggers New Research (Future Scope)**
Often, interpretation reveals questions that are still unanswered. If the results are unexpected, the interpretation phase explains *why* and suggests what future researchers should explore next. This keeps the cycle of research alive.

---

**3. Precautions in Interpretation**

Interpreting data is a risky task. A wrong interpretation can make the entire research invalid, even if the data collection was perfect. A researcher must observe the following precautions:

**1. Avoid False Generalization**

- **The Risk:** Applying the results of a small, specific group to a large, unrelated group.
- **Precaution:** The researcher must clearly state the **Scope** and **Limitations** of the study.
    - *Example:* If you tested an app on Android, do not interpret that it works well on "all smartphones" (including iOS).

**2. Distinguish Between Correlation and Causation**

- **The Risk:** Assuming that because two things happen together, one causes the other.
- **Precaution:** Just because variable A and B change together (Correlation), it does not mean A causes B. There could be a third hidden factor.
    - *Example:* High GPU usage and high heat occur together. But the heat doesn't cause the usage; the computation causes both.

**3. Ensure Data Reliability**

- **The Risk:** Interpreting data that was flawed from the start.
- **Precaution:** Before interpreting, the researcher must double-check that the data collection tools were accurate and the statistical methods (t-test, etc.) were correct. If the input is garbage, the interpretation will be garbage.

**4. Watch Out for "Extraneous Variables"**

- **The Risk:** Hidden factors that influence the result but were ignored.
- **Precaution:** The researcher must identify factors that were not controlled.
    - *Example:* If a network speed test showed slow results, was it the algorithm, or was the university internet just slow that day? The interpretation must account for this.

**5. Avoid Personal Bias**

- **The Risk:** Trying to force the data to fit what you *wanted* to find, rather than what is actually there.
- **Precaution:** The researcher must remain objective. If the hypothesis failed, admit it. A failed hypothesis is still a valid scientific result.

**6. Consultation with Experts**

- **Precaution:** Before finalizing the report, the researcher should discuss the findings with someone else (a supervisor or peer). A fresh pair of eyes can often spot logical fallacies in interpretation that the researcher missed.

### Unit-2

**Q4 (a): Define plagiarism and discuss its implications in academic and professional research. How can researchers ensure originality and avoid unintentional plagiarism? (9 Marks)**

**Answer 4(a):**

**1. Definition of Plagiarism**
Plagiarism is the unethical act of using another person's words, ideas, processes, results, or figures without giving appropriate credit. It is essentially intellectual theft. Even if the act is accidental (unintentional), it is still considered plagiarism in the academic world.

**2. Implications of Plagiarism**
Plagiarism has severe consequences in both academic and professional settings:

- **Legal Consequences:** Copyright infringement can lead to lawsuits and heavy financial fines.
- **Academic Penalties:** For students, it can result in failing a course, suspension, or expulsion. For researchers, it leads to the retraction of published papers (a permanent mark of shame).
- **Loss of Reputation:** A researcher caught plagiarizing loses credibility instantly. Their future work will always be viewed with suspicion by peers.
- **Stifling Innovation:** If researchers merely copy instead of creating, no new knowledge is generated. It halts the progress of science.

**3. Ensuring Originality and Avoiding Unintentional Plagiarism**
Researchers can avoid this trap by following these strict guidelines:

- **Paraphrasing:** Do not just replace a few words with synonyms. Read the original text, understand the core idea, close the source, and rewrite it entirely in your own words.
- **Proper Citation:** Use standard citation styles (like IEEE for CSE) immediately after using an idea. Do not wait until the end of the paper to add citations.
- **Use of Plagiarism Checkers:** Before submission, run the document through tools like **Turnitin**, **Urkund**, or **Grammarly** to catch accidental similarities.
- **Quote Exactly:** If you must use the exact words, place them in "quotation marks" and cite the page number.

**Q4 (b): Discuss the importance of clarity and conciseness in technical writing. What are some common mistakes in technical writing and how can they be avoided? (6 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. Importance of Clarity and Conciseness**
Technical writing is functional, not creative. Its goal is to transfer information efficiently from the expert to the user.

- **Clarity:** Ensures the reader understands the exact meaning without ambiguity. In engineering, a misunderstood instruction (e.g., in a safety manual) can be dangerous.
- **Conciseness (Brevity):** Respects the reader's time. It involves using the fewest words possible to convey the complete meaning. Complex sentences confuse readers and obscure the main point.

**2. Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them**

| **Common Mistake** | **How to Avoid It** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ambiguity** | Use specific, measurable words. | *Bad:* "The system is fast." 
 *Good:* "The system response time is 20ms." |
| **Jargon Overload** | Define acronyms on first use. | Don't assume the reader knows what "SDN" or "LSTM" means; explain it once. |
| **Passive Voice** | Use Active Voice for stronger, clearer sentences. | *Bad:* "The code was written by the team." 
 *Good:* "The team wrote the code." |
| **Redundancy** | Remove unnecessary words. | *Bad:* "The two different algorithms..." 
 *Good:* "The two algorithms..." (Different is implied). |

**Q5 (a): How should researchers organise content in the introduction, body and conclusion of a report? (8 Marks)**

**Answer:**

A well-organized report guides the reader logically from the problem to the solution.

**1. Introduction (The "Why")**

- **Background:** Introduce the broad field (e.g., "Cloud Computing is growing...").
- **Problem Statement:** Narrow down to the specific issue (e.g., "However, security remains a challenge...").
- **Objectives:** State clearly what this report aims to achieve.
- **Scope:** Define the boundaries (what is included/excluded).

**2. Body (The "How" and "What")**
The body is usually divided into multiple chapters or sections:

- **Literature Review:** Summary of existing work to show you know the field.
- **Methodology:** Detailed steps of the experiment or design. This should be detailed enough for someone else to replicate.
- **Data/Analysis:** Presentation of raw data using graphs, tables, and charts.
- **Discussion:** Interpreting the results. Explain *why* the results happened and how they fit with previous theories.

**3. Conclusion (The "So What")**

- **Summary:** Briefly restate the problem and the main findings.
- **Inference:** What is the final takeaway? Did you solve the problem?
- **Future Scope:** Suggest what could be improved in future studies. *Do not add new data in the conclusion.*

**Q5 (b): Explain how to write an effective objective and scope section in a research proposal. (7 Marks)**

**Answer 5 (b):**

**1. Writing Effective Objectives**
Objectives define the *goals* of the research.

- **Primary Objective:** The main aim (mirrors the title).
- **Secondary Objectives:** The sub-goals or steps to reach the main aim.
- **SMART Criteria:** Objectives must be **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**ealistic, and **T**ime-bound.
    - *Example:* Instead of "To study AI," write "To design a Neural Network that achieves 95% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition."

**2. Writing Effective Scope**
The scope defines the *boundaries* of the study.

- **Inclusions:** Explicitly state what the study covers.
    - *Example:* "This study focuses on IPv6 protocols in static wireless networks."
- **Delimitations (Exclusions):** Explicitly state what is *not* covered to prevent unrealistic expectations.
    - *Example:* "This study does not cover the security aspects of the protocol, nor does it test on mobile nodes."
- **Benefit:** A clear scope protects the researcher during the defense. If an examiner asks, "Why didn't you test security?", you can point to the scope and say, "That was outside the defined boundary of this specific project."

### Unit-3

**Q6: Explain the differences between patents, industrial designs, trademarks, and copyrights. Provide examples for each. (15 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. Introduction**
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) are legal rights granted to creators and inventors to protect their creations. While they all fall under the umbrella of "IP," they protect very different things.

**2. Differences between Patent, Design, Trademark, and Copyright**

| **Feature** | **Patent** | **Industrial Design** | **Trademark** | **Copyright** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **What it Protects?** | **Inventions.** New functionalities, processes, machines, or methods. (The "Utility"). | **Appearance.** The aesthetic look, shape, pattern, or color of a product. (The "Look"). | **Brand Identity.** Distinctive signs, names, logos, or slogans that identify the source. | **Expression of Ideas.** Literary, artistic, musical, and dramatic works, including **Software Code**. |
| **Criteria for Protection** | Must be **Novel** (new), **Non-obvious** (inventive), and **Useful** (industrial application). | Must be **New** and **Original** (visual appeal). It must not be functional. | Must be **Distinctive** and not confuse consumers with existing brands. | Must be **Original** and fixed in a tangible medium. (Protection is automatic upon creation). |
| **Duration (in India)** | **20 Years** (Renewable annually). | **10 Years** (+5 years extension). | **10 Years** (Indefinitely renewable). | **Lifetime of Author + 60 Years.** |
| **Right Granted** | Right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or importing the invention. | Right to prevent others from copying the visual design. | Right to prevent others from using a confusingly similar mark. | Right to reproduce, distribute, display, and perform the work. |

**3. CSE-Specific Examples (Crucial for your Exam)**

- **Patent:**
    - **Example:** **Google’s PageRank Algorithm** (method of ranking search results) or the hardware design of a **TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)** chip.
    - *Why:* It is a functional invention that solves a technical problem.
- **Industrial Design:**
    - **Example:** The specific **rounded rectangular shape of the iPhone** or the design of a **gaming mouse**.
    - *Why:* It protects how the device *looks*, not how the electronics inside work.
- **Trademark:**
    - **Example:** The **Apple Logo**, the name **"Microsoft Windows"**, or the **Java Coffee Cup** icon.
    - *Why:* It identifies the brand. If I sell a laptop with an Apple logo, consumers know it's from Apple.
- **Copyright:**
    - **Example:** The **Source Code** of Windows 11, a **User Manual**, or a **Research Paper** you wrote.
    - *Why:* It protects the specific written expression. If someone copies your code line-by-line, they violate copyright.

**Q7 (a): Discuss the role of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in promoting international cooperation on IP. (8 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. Introduction to WIPO**
The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is a specialized agency of the **United Nations (UN)**, established in 1967 and headquartered in **Geneva, Switzerland**. Its mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all.

**2. Role in Promoting International Cooperation**
WIPO acts as the global forum for IP services, policy, and cooperation in the following ways:

- **Administration of International Treaties:**
WIPO administers 26 international treaties that harmonize IP laws across countries.
    - **Paris Convention:** Protects industrial property (Patents, Trademarks).
    - **Berne Convention:** Protects literary and artistic works (Copyright).
    - **PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty):** Allows inventors to seek patent protection in roughly 150 countries by filing a single international application.
- **Global Registration Systems:**
WIPO simplifies the process of protecting IP across borders, reducing costs for inventors:
    - **Madrid System:** For International Registration of Marks (Trademarks).
    - **Hague System:** For International Registration of Industrial Designs.
    - **Lisbon System:** For Geographical Indications.
- **Harmonization of IP Laws:**
WIPO brings member states together to negotiate and agree on common standards. This ensures that an Indian patent is respected and understood similarly in other nations, reducing legal friction in global trade.
- **Dispute Resolution:**
The **WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center** provides a neutral, international forum to resolve private IP disputes (e.g., Domain Name disputes) without going to court, which saves time and money.
- **Development Cooperation (Capacity Building):**
WIPO helps developing countries (like India) build their own IP infrastructure.
    - **Training:** They train examiners and judges.
    - **Technical Assistance:** They help countries digitize their patent offices.
    - **WIPO Academy:** Offers courses to students and professionals to increase IP awareness globally.

**Conclusion:**
WIPO acts as the "glue" that holds the global IP system together, ensuring that creativity and innovation are protected not just locally, but globally.

**Q7 (b): Describe the steps involved in filing an International patent application. (7 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. Introduction**
When we speak of an "International Patent Application," we are referring to the **PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty)** route administered by **WIPO**.

- **Crucial Concept:** The PCT does **not** grant an "international patent." There is no such thing. Instead, it provides a unified procedure for *filing* a patent application to protect inventions in its member countries (approx. 157 countries) simultaneously.

**2. The PCT Timeline (The Two Phases)**
The process is divided into two distinct phases: the **International Phase** and the **National Phase**.

**Phase I: The International Phase**

This phase is handled by WIPO and international authorities.

- **Step 1: Filing (Month 0)**
    - The applicant files a single "International Application" with their local patent office (Receiving Office - RO) or directly with WIPO.
    - *Benefit:* You file in **one language** and pay **one set of fees**, effectively holding your place in all member countries.
- **Step 2: International Search (Month 16)**
    - An **International Searching Authority (ISA)** (a major patent office like USPTO, EPO, or Indian Patent Office) conducts a search of existing technology (Prior Art).
    - They produce an **International Search Report (ISR)** and a **Written Opinion** on whether the invention appears to be novel and patentable.
- **Step 3: International Publication (Month 18)**
    - WIPO publishes the application to the world on its database (PATENTSCOPE). The content of your invention is now public knowledge.
- **Step 4: Optional Examination (Month 22 - Optional)**
    - The applicant can request an **International Preliminary Examination (IPE)** if they want a more detailed analysis to convince future patent offices of the invention's validity.

**Phase II: The National Phase**

This is where the actual patent granting happens.

- **Step 5: Entry into National Phase (Month 30 or 31)**
    - This is the deadline. By the end of 30 or 31 months (depending on the country) from the priority date, the applicant must strictly decide which specific countries they want to enter (e.g., USA, India, Germany).
    - **Action Required:**
        - Pay the **National Fees** to each country's patent office.
        - Submit **Translations** of the application into the local language.
        - Appoint local patent agents.

**3. Conclusion**
Once the application enters the National Phase, it effectively becomes a national application. The US Patent Office will examine it under US law, and the Indian Patent Office under Indian law. They will then Grant or Refuse the patent independently.

- **Why use this process?** It buys the inventor **18 extra months** (30 months total vs. 12 months in the traditional route) to test the market and find investors before spending huge money on translation and national fees.

### Unit-4

**Q8 (a): Discuss the scope of patent rights in protecting inventions and the limitations imposed on them. (8 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. Scope of Patent Rights**
When a patent is granted, it does not give the owner the "freedom to use" (because their invention might still infringe on someone else's earlier patent). Instead, it gives a negative right—the **"Right to Exclude."**

- **Exclusive Rights:** The patentee has the exclusive right to prevent third parties from the following acts without consent:
    - **Making:** Manufacturing the product.
    - **Using:** Using the process or product commercially.
    - **Selling:** Offering the product for sale.
    - **Importing:** Bringing the product into the country.
- **Territorial Scope:** The rights are valid *only* within the country where the patent is granted (e.g., an Indian patent offers no protection in the USA).
- **Temporal Scope:** The protection lasts for **20 years** from the date of filing, provided renewal fees are paid.

**2. Limitations Imposed on Patent Rights**
The government imposes certain restrictions to balance the monopoly of the inventor with the welfare of the public.

- **Compulsory Licensing:** If the patentee fails to meet public demand or charges an exorbitant price (e.g., for a life-saving drug), the government can force them to license the patent to others.
- **Government Use:** The government can use any patented invention for its own purposes (e.g., defense or emergencies) without asking for permission.
- **Experimental / Research Use:** Anyone can use a patented invention for the purpose of experiment, research, or teaching. You don't need a license to study a patent in a university lab.
- **Exhaustion of Rights:** Once the patentee sells a product to a customer, they lose control over it. The customer is free to resell it or repair it (Right to Repair).

---

**Q8 (b): When is a registered geographical indication said to be infringed? Who can initiate an infringement action? (7 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. When is a GI Infringed?**
A Registered Geographical Indication (GI) (like "Basmati Rice" or "Darjeeling Tea") is considered infringed if an unauthorized person does the following:

- **False Representation:** Uses the GI name on a product that does *not* originate from that specific geographical locality.
    - *Example:* Selling tea grown in Gujarat as "Darjeeling Tea."
- **Misleading the Public:** Uses a name that suggests the product comes from a famous region to trick consumers into believing it has specific qualities associated with that region.
- **Unfair Competition:** Any act that constitutes "passing off" their goods as the goods of the registered GI holder.

**2. Who can initiate an infringement action?**
Unlike a trademark where a single company sues, GI is a collective right. The following parties can initiate legal action:

- **The Registered Proprietor:** Usually an association of persons, producers, or an authority established by law (e.g., The Tea Board of India for Darjeeling Tea).
- **The Authorized User:** Any individual producer (farmer/artisan) who is registered as an authorized user of that GI.

**Q9 (a): Describe the key administrative functions of a patent office and their role in the patenting process. (8 Marks)**

**Answer:**

The Patent Office acts as the "Gatekeeper" of the innovation ecosystem. Its primary role is to ensure that monopolies are only granted to genuinely new and useful inventions.

**Key Administrative Functions:**

1. **Receiving and Digitizing Applications:**
    - The office acts as the intake center for all Forms (Form 1, Provisional Specs). They digitize documents for the online database.
2. **Publication (Transparency Role):**
    - They publish patent applications in the **Official Journal** after 18 months. This ensures that the knowledge becomes public (preventing secret inventions).
3. **Examination (The Filter Role):**
    - This is the most critical function. Patent Examiners search global databases (Prior Art search) to check if the invention is truly **Novel** and **Non-obvious**.
    - They issue the **First Examination Report (FER)** listing objections.
4. **Granting or Refusing:**
    - The Controller of Patents makes the final legal decision to grant the patent certificate or refuse it based on the examiner's report and the applicant's response.
5. **Maintenance and Renewal:**
    - They collect annual renewal fees to keep the patent alive for 20 years. If fees aren't paid, they announce the patent has "lapsed."
6. **Dispute Resolution (Opposition):**
    - They handle "Pre-grant" and "Post-grant" oppositions where third parties argue that a patent shouldn't be valid.

---

**Q9 (b): How is intellectual property protection applied to computer software? Discuss the role of patents and copyrights. (7 Marks)**

**Answer:**

**1. The Dual Nature of Software**
Software is unique because it is both a "written work" (code) and a "functional tool" (machine). Therefore, it sits between Copyright and Patent law.

**2. Role of Copyright (The Default Protection)**

- **What it Protects:** Copyright protects the **"Expression"**—the literal lines of Source Code and Object Code.
- **Application:** It applies automatically the moment code is written. It prevents others from "Copy-Pasting" your code or selling pirated copies.
- **Limitation:** It does *not* protect the idea or algorithm. If a competitor writes *different* code (Reverse Engineering) to achieve the *exact same functionality*, copyright cannot stop them.

**3. Role of Patents (The Stronger Protection)**

- **What it Protects:** Patents protect the **"Functionality"** or the underlying technical idea/algorithm.
- **The Challenge (Section 3(k) in India):** In India, "computer programs per se" are **not patentable**. You cannot patent a standalone algorithm.
- **The Solution:** Software *can* be patented if it shows a **"Technical Effect"** or is embedded in hardware.
    - *Example:* Software that controls the fuel injection in a car engine is patentable because it improves a physical process.
    - *CSE Context:* A pure sorting algorithm is not patentable. But an algorithm that reduces battery consumption in IoT sensors (hardware interaction) might be.

**Conclusion:**

- **Copyright** is for protecting the code from piracy.
- **Patents** are for protecting the invention/method from being re-implemented by competitors.
