/* ✔️⭐Approach - 1 (custom sort function and strings)
     
    idea : if we do normal sort lets say on the given test case on basis of their first digits  :- [3,30,34,5,9]
            normal sort = {9,5,34,30,3} then ans will be -> 9534303 (WRONG ANSWER,correct= 9534330)

            so we need to sort it in such a way that before placing any number our algo checks both the arrangements i.e for eg. "30" "3"   now both arrangements will be -> "303" "330" now we know that 330 (3,30) is greater so place 3 before 30 in the array 

    therefore if (a+b > b+a) that means a should be placed before b and it is alrady on left
    but if (a+b < b+a) then that means b should be placed before a so swap(a,b) to make b on left

            This way we will arrange our array in decreasing order.
            So at last we can easily form a ans string.

        🔍note : we converted digits to string because we strings can be concatenated, so its easy to form "101" from 10 and 1 but its difficult when both are integers

    ✅T : O(nlogn)
    S : O(1)

class Solution {
        
        // sorts the array in custom decreasing order, such that if 2 ints 'a' and 'b' such that ab > ba then a comes before b in the array, else if ab < ba then b comes before a.  
    class compare{
        public:
        bool operator()(int a, int b){
            return (to_string(a) + to_string(b) > to_string(b) + to_string(a));
        } 
    };

public:
    string largestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), compare()); // sorting the nums array in such a way that if there are 2 elements "101" and "12" then we will check both arrangements "10112" and "12101" now we know 12101 is greater so "12" should come before "101" in the array 'nums' because we are sorting it in decreasing order

        string largestNumStr = "";
        for(int num:nums)  // since we have decreasing array, now add each number to the 'ans' strings end
            largestNumStr += to_string(num);
        
        if(largestNumStr[0] == '0') return "0"; // exception case

        return largestNumStr;
    }

};
