## ✔️⭐  Approach - 3  (recursive dp approach) - optimized version of bruteforce app-2
```cpp

    /* ✔️⭐ Approach - 3 (recursive dp approach) - optimized version of app-2

            idea : total ways to reach the top is equal to sum of ways to reach (n-1)th and (n-2)th step, how ? 
            lets say our top is nth stair so we know that we can take only 1 or 2 steps at a time(not more then that), so if we reached the (n-1)th stair in lets say x different ways and (n-2)th stair in y different ways, then to reach from n-1 th stair to top we only need to take single step and from (n-2)th stair to top we only need to take 2 steps at ones, so total ways in which we can reach the top are totalWaysToReachStair(n-1) + totalWaysToReachStair(n-2) i.e x + y  

        T : O(n) 
        S : O(n)

    int noOfWays(int n, vector<int> &dp){

        // total ways to reach 1st step = 1
        // total ways to reach 2nd stair is 2 (either take 1 step or 2 steps at a time)
        if(n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2) return n;

        if(dp[n] != -1) // means ans already found previously 
            return dp[n];
        // find answer
        return dp[n] = noOfWays(n-1, dp) + noOfWays(n-2, dp); // total ways to reach the top is equal to sum of ways to reach n-1th and n-2th step
