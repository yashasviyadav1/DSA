# 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence

### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/description)

```cpp
class Solution {
    /* ✔️⭐Approach - 2 (greedy)

        idea : - we maintain 2 variables 'a' and 'b', now when an (element <= a) we update a, also when an (element > a && element < b), we update b, and whenever we get an element which is greater then both 'a' and 'b' that mens we found out triplet (return true)
                 note that acc to our algo, at all times (a < b), and if an element is > b that means a < b < element (triplet found), that is why this algo works

        T : O(n)
        S : O(1)
