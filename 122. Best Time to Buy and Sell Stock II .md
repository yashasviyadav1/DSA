## Approach - 1 (linear time)

```cpp
class Solution {
    /*✔️⭐ Appoach - 1 (optimal approach)

        note : this is the modified version of app-3 (from buy sell stocks i)
    prerequisite : https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

     idea : keep on minimizing the cp and maximizing the sp, and at any point if we find that curr point is less then the sp, that means there is a fall, so sell the stock at prv sp and then reset both sp and cp after selling the stock, think of loop's i variable as 'future' i.e we are in future and whever we find prices are less then sp, then we go to past and sell that stock.

        ✅ T : O(n)
        ✅ S : O(1)

public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {

        int cp = prices[0]; // minimise cp
        int sp = prices[0]; // maximise sp
        int totalProfit = 0;
        
        for(int i=1; i < prices.size(); i++){

            // when curr price is less then sp, then sell the stock (and reset cp and sp)
            if(prices[i] < sp){
                totalProfit += (sp-cp);
                sp = INT_MIN; 
                cp = INT_MAX;
            }

            // update sp, cp
            sp = max(sp, prices[i]);
            cp = min(cp, prices[i]);
        }

        // add the last profit to also 
        totalProfit += (sp-cp);

        return totalProfit;


        
    }
};
