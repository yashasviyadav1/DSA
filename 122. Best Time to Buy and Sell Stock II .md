## Approach - 1 (linear time)

```cpp
class Solution {
    /*✔️⭐ Appoach - 1 (optimal approach)

        note : this is the modified version of app-3 (from buy sell stocks i)
    prerequisite : https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

        idea : idea is simple, we need to minimize the cp, maximize the sp, now whenever there is a dip (the point just before stock will rise again) buy the stock, and whenver there is the peak (the point just before stock will fall again), sell the stock, and make sure to reset the cp, sp after selling the stock

        ✅ T : O(n)
        ✅ S : O(1)
    */
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {

        int cp = prices[0]; // minimise cp
        int sp = prices[0]; // maximise sp
        int totalProfit = 0;
        
        for(int i=1; i < prices.size(); i++){

            // when curr price is less then sp, then sell the stock (and reset cp and sp)
            if(prices[i] < sp){
                totalProfit += (sp-cp);
                sp = INT_MIN; 
                cp = INT_MAX;
            }

            // update sp, cp
            sp = max(sp, prices[i]);
            cp = min(cp, prices[i]);
        }

        // add the last profit to also 
        totalProfit += (sp-cp);

        return totalProfit;


        
    }
};

```
