/* ✔️⭐Approach -1 (modified approach -1)

     idea : we consider index 0 as the starting point and go on to the station wheree we fail to reach, now if we failed at a point 'x' which is on right of the starting point 's'. so lets say start=3 , and we failed to reach '7' then if we can not reach 7 starting from 3 then how can we reach 7 starting from 4,5,6 so to reduce the time, we consider new start as the prv failed point i.e 7, and start the algorithm again, now just make sure for cases like :  gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3], here we can be trapped into a infinite time case, because we need to take care of one more thing :- 

            station : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
        lets say starting from station '5' , we know that 1,2,3,4 can not be the starting point, so if stating from 5 we failed at station 3(on left of 'start') then that means including '5'(start) all points on right of start are useless also, so we know that no answer exists.

### Approach - 1 (⚠️TLE)
```cpp
class Solution {

    // Approach -1 (brute force)
    // idea : we consider each index as the starting point for out journey, and we we reached at the start again , then we return the start, if not then we consider the next index as the start point and check again
    // T :  O(n^2)

public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {

        int n = gas.size();
        for(int start = 0; start < n; start++){

            int totalGas = gas[start];
            int nextStation = start + 1; // keeping track of the nextStation and prv index
            if(start == n-1)
                nextStation = 0;
            int prv = start;
            
            while(1){ // this loop will move in circular manner
                
                // when our gas is more then or equal to the gas required to move to nextStation, then we move
                if(totalGas >= cost[prv]) // when we move we sub the gas used, add the gas filled at next station
                    totalGas += (-cost[prv] + gas[nextStation]);

                else break;// cant move

                if(nextStation == start) return start; // if we reached at the start again, then we found our answer

                // updation
                prv = nextStation;
                if(nextStation == n-1) // circular movement
                    nextStation = 0;
                else nextStation++;  
            }
        }

        return -1; // no station found where we can reach again
        
    }
