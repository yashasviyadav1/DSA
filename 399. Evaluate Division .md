‚≠ê‚úîÔ∏è Approach - 1.1 (DFS ,  bidirectional graph - biweighted graph , diff type of AdjList )

        explanation :-   firstly recognize it as a graph problem (which is th e tricky path), now what type of graph should we make for this, now see we are working on fraction here, i.e for example we are given, a/b = 2.0 so what if we do reciprocal of it then it becomes b/a = 1/2.0 , so taking a and b as verticies(nodes) and their value of fractions as edge weight we can create a graph like, 
          
          (a)--2.0-->(b) which represents a/b = 2.0, and 
          
          (b)--0.5-->(a) which represents reciprocal of above i.e b/a = 1/2 = 0.5

          üîçnote :- that this is a bidirectional graph but not a normal one, (in a normal bidirectional graph our edge has directions on both sides but this edge weight is same eg. (x)<--4--->(y) ,but in our case our graph is bidirectional but with diff edge weight on both directions )

          now lets say we want to find the value of a/c , we can do that by starting from node a and appling DFS till we reach the node c, and while travelling make sure to do the product of all the edge that comes between the a and c (only which comes in the path)

        if(src == desti)
            return 1.0;

        visited.insert(src);

        for(auto [neigh,weight]:AdjList[src]){

            // if neigh is not visited, then rec find ans from the depth of neighbour, and if ans is found then just mutiply current 'weight' with the ans product of weights we got
