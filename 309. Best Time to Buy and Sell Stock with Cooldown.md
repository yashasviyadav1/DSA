prerequisite : [buy sell stocks ii,iii,iv](leetcode.com)

#### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)


-------
note : we do not have to space optimize it, although we can but there is no need coz we would need 3 1d arrays for that here so its not optimal thing to do

------
More optimized (lesser line code with exactly same aporoach)
## ✔️Approach - 2 (precise code - tabulation)
```java
class Solution {
    // App-3.2 (more precise code for Tabulation)
    // Removed the buy loop and if conditions from code with dp[][0] and dp[][1], coz its not necessary 
    // T:O(n)  S:O(n*2) - dp
    
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int n = prices.length;
        // more prcise code for tabulation here
        int[][] dp = new int[n+2][2]; // i, buy

        dp[n][0] = dp[n][1] = 0; // base
        dp[n+1][0] = dp[n+1][1] = 0;

        // iteration
        for(int index = n-1; index >= 0; index--){
            dp[index][1] = Math.max( -prices[index] + dp[index+1][0] , dp[index+1][1]); // buy today or buy later
            dp[index][0] = Math.max( +prices[index] +dp[index + 2][1], dp[index+1][0]);
        }
        return dp[0][1]; // buy=1 initially always
    }
}
```

## ✔️Approach - 2 (bottom up dp - tabulation)
```java
class Solution {
    // T:O(n)  S:O(n) - dp
    // App-3 (bottom up dp - tabulation)
    // prerequisite : buy sell stocks ii,iii,iv
    /*
        imp point : after sell, we can not buy on next day so here we go to next of next after selling i.e i+2
         rest remains same
    */
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        int n = prices.length;
        // memoization to tabulation
        // in rec we had dp[n][2] here we need dp[n+2][2] coz we have to fill base case index>=n  and also we had to call solve(i+2) after sell
        // so suppose we at i = n-1 in the loop , so we need for dp[i+2] here so for n=5  i=4 we need to get value of i+2 i.e 4+2 i.e 6 so declare 2 extra rows
        int[][] dp = new int[n+2][2]; // i, buy

        // base case - index >= n so fill 0, for i=n and i=n+1 
        dp[n][0] = dp[n][1] = 0;
        dp[n+1][0] = dp[n+1][1] = 0;

        // iteration
        for(int index = n-1; index >= 0; index--){
            for(int buy = 0; buy <= 1; buy++){
                int profit = 0;
                // can buy today
                if(buy == 1){ 
                    profit = Math.max( -prices[index] + dp[index+1][0] , dp[index+1][1]); // buy today or buy later
                }
                else{// sell today(then skip next day for cooldown so i+2) or sell later so i+1
                    profit = Math.max( +prices[index] +dp[index + 2][1], dp[index+1][0]);
                }
                dp[index][buy] = profit;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][1]; // buy=1 initially always
    }
}
```

using 2d space only using 2 variables `index` and `buy`
## ✔️Approach - 1.1 (top down dp, memoization)
```java
class Solution {
    // T:O(n)  S:O(2*n) - dp,rec
    // App-2 (top down dp memoization)
    // prerequisite : buy sell stocks ii,iii,iv
    /*
        imp point : after sell, we can not buy on next day so here we go to next of next after selling i.e i+2
         rest remains same
    */
    private int solve(int[] prices, int[][] dp, int index, int buy){
        if(index >= prices.length) return 0; // > coz we might take +2 step after sell so might go out of bound
        if(dp[index][buy] != -1) return dp[index][buy];

        int profit = 0;
        // can buy today
        if(buy == 1){ 
            profit = Math.max( -prices[index] + solve(prices, dp, index+1, 0) 
                                    ,solve(prices, dp, index+1, 1) // buy today or buy later
                     );
        }
        else{
            // sell today(then skip next day for cooldown so i+2) or sell later so i+1
            profit = Math.max( +prices[index] + solve(prices, dp, index + 2, 1) // after selling cooldownComplete becomes 0 (means need cooldown for 1 day)
                               , solve(prices, dp, index+1, 0)); // not sell means cooldown is already completed
        }
        return dp[index][buy] = profit;
    }
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = 1;
        int n = prices.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][2]; // i, buy
        for(int[] row:dp)
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);

        return solve(prices, dp, 0, buy);
    }
}
```

-----
using 3D dp as space for 3 changing state variable `index` `buy` and `cooldownCompleted`
## ✔️Approach - 1 (top down dop, memoization)
```java
class Solution {
    // T:O(n)  S:O(2*2*n) 
    // top down dp memoization
    // prerequisite : buy sell stocks ii,iii,iv
    /*
        all cases :- 
         
         if(buy == 1 && cooldown is also completed)
            either we can buy today, or buy later 
         else if(buy == 1 but cooldown is not complete)
            so we can only buy later not today
         else (buy == 0 means we can sell)
            so either we can sell today (if we sell today then cooldown becomes 0 for 1 day)
            or we can sell later (that means we are skipping curr day so set cooldownComplete to 1) 
    */
    private int solve(int[] prices, int[][][] dp, int index, int buy, int cooldownCompleted){
        if(index == prices.length) return 0;
        if(dp[index][buy][cooldownCompleted] != -1) return dp[index][buy][cooldownCompleted];

        int profit = 0;
        // can buy today and cooldown is also completed
        if(buy == 1){
            if(cooldownCompleted == 1){ // elidgible to buy today or buy later
                profit = Math.max( -prices[index] + solve(prices, dp, index+1, 0, 1) // buy or not buy doesn't effect the cooldown so it stays 1 here 
                                    ,solve(prices, dp, index+1, 1, 1)
                         );
            }
            else{ // buy later skip curr day for cooldown
                profit = solve(prices, dp, index+1, 1, 1);
            }
        }
        else{
            // sell today sell later
            profit = Math.max( +prices[index] + solve(prices, dp, index+1, 1, 0) // after selling cooldownComplete becomes 0 (means need cooldown for 1 day)
                               , solve(prices, dp, index+1, 0, 1)); // not sell means cooldown is already completed
        }
        return dp[index][buy][cooldownCompleted] = profit;
    }
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy = 1;
        int cooldownCompleted = 1; // 1 means true
        int n = prices.length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n][2][2]; // i, buy, cooldow completed
        for(int[][] twoD:dp)
            for(int[] row:twoD)
                Arrays.fill(row, -1);

        return solve(prices, dp, 0, buy, cooldownCompleted);
    }
