## Approach - 2 
```java
class Solution {
    /*✔️⭐Approach - 2 (RECURSIVE bruteforce + 2d dp)

            idea : we will be comparing last characters

                Case1 : a b c d     e f c d 
                            d == d, means we found 1 common char in a subseq, so add 1 to answer and for the remaining strings a b c   and  e f c , calculate ans recursively
                Case2.1 : a b c d    e f c x 
                            d != x, means both characters are unequal, so we will fix strings1, and reduce string2 by 1 length so that we can find the longest common subsequence in the left, so new string becomes a b c d   and e f c 

                Case2.2 : a b c d    e f c x 
                            d != x, means both characters are unequal, so we will fix strings2, and reduce string1 by 1 length so that we can find the longest common subsequence in their left parts, so new string becomes a b c   and e f c x

                    now in case2.1 and 2.2 whatever returns the maximum longest common substring.
