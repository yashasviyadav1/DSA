# 213. House Robber II

#### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/description/)


### Approach - 1 (rec bruteforce dp)
```cpp
class Solution {
    /* ✔️⭐Approach - 1 (bruteforce dp inspired by house robber 1)

            prerequisite : house robber 1  (must)
            idea : in house robber 1 we found the maxMoneyStollen from houses 1st to n, but in this case we need to find max money stollen from 1 to (n-1) and 2 to n, and then whatever is max we will return it, but for this we need to maintain to different dp arrays, because if we use only 1 then the dp values from call(1 to n-1) will be used in call(2 to n) and then ans will be wrong

            T : O(n)
            S : O(2n)
