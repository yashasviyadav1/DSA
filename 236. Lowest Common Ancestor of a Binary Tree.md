### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/)

## Approach - 1 (Recursive)

java solution
```java

class Solution {
    /* ☑️Approach - 1 (recursion) - java

        idea : lca of empty node is null, if we found one of the p or q nodes then return them because LCA of every node is that node itself, if at a node we have both leftAns and rightAnd as not null, that means that node is the LCA node we want, so return root at that node

        T : O(n)
        S : O(n) - recursive stack

    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        // base case
        if(root == null || root == p || root == q)// either we found 1 node or null
            return root;
        
        TreeNode leftAns = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode rightAns = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        if(leftAns != null && rightAns != null) // both left and right ans are non null
            return root; // found our ans
        
        else if(leftAns != null)  // only 1 of the leftANs and rightAns are non null
            return leftAns;
