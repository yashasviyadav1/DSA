### Approach - 1 (recursive)
```java
// we have a maintree and secondtree now we need to merge maintrees left part with seconds's left (recursively), then main trees right with second's right (recursively) than merge the main tree and second trees root node (sum) and return the newly merged tree's root
// imp base case : when root1 is null and root2 is not null, we attach root2 to parent of root1
class Solution {
    public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if(root1 == null && root2 == null) return null;
        else if(root1 != null && root2 == null) return root1;
        else if(root1 == null && root2 != null) return root2;
        root1.left = mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left);
        root1.right = mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right);
        root1.val += root2.val;
        return root1;  
    }
}
```
