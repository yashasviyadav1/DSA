```java
  class Solution {
    /* Approach-1 (sort and check)

         idea : approach is simple, its given that each partition must have 3 elements always 
                so lets say we have 12 elements then no of partitions will be 12/3 -> 4 i.e 4 inner arrays with 3 elements each 
                nums = [4,8,5,1,6,3,11,4] k = 2 (i.e in each partition abs different of any 2 elements must be <= k)
                look the abs diff of smallest element - largest element => 11 - 1 = 10 that means that the elements with largest differnece can not be in the same partition i.e larger the diff 
                lesser are their chances to be in same partition.

                so if we minimize the diff of elemenets then only we can store them in same partition, so for that we will sort the nums array
                sorted = 1,3,4,4,5,6,8,11    note that diff in adj elements is least now, lets pick each element one by 1 and store them in each partition

                vip : since we have the data as sorted in asc order, so lets say if k=3 in a partition we have [3,6,7,7] so if currEle = 9, since our data is sorted
                      so we only need to compare currEle with 1st element of partition because part1[0] i.e 1st ele is smallest and curr is largest (among partition) so if abs(largest-smallest) <= k then the diff of all ele of that partition
                      with the curr will always be <= k so only check with 1st element (coz arry is sorted)
          Time : O(n*m)
          Space : O(n*m)
