# 22. Generate Parentheses 

### Solved at : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/description/)


Recursion tree and understanding the approach :- 
```cpp
op = remaining open brackets/parenthesis
ip = remaining closed brackets/parenthesis

                                    op      ip
                                    ""   O-3, C-3
                            
                                    "(",O-2,C-3
                    
                "((",O-1,C-3                            "()", O-2,C-2

    "(((",0,3             "(()",1,2                       "()(",1,2

    "((()",0,2      "(()(",0,2    "(())",1,1        "()((",0,2      "()()",1,1

    "((())",0,1     "(()()",0,1   "(())(",0,1       "()(()",0,1     "()()(",0,1

    "((()))",0,0   "(()())",0,0   "(())()",0,0      "()(())",0,0    "()()()", 0,0
                        
```

```cpp
class Solution {
    /* ‚úîÔ∏è‚≠êApproach - 1 (backtracking and recursion)

        idea : there are a few imp points that we really need to take care of
                i) we stop when both the remaining count of open and closed brackets becomes 0
                ii) when the preceding parenthesis  balanced (i.e remOpenBrackets == remClosedBrackets) then in that case always add open bracket to the string because lets say for n==3 currString is ()() here reamaining open and closed brackets are both 1, so we need to add open brackets here, we can not add closed bracket to a balanced parenthesis
                iii) if remaining openBrackets == 0 then then use ')' closed brackets
                iv) if rem closed brackets == 0 then use '(' open brackets 
                v) else for all remaining cases we have 2 choices, either we can add a open bracket or a closed bracket 

        üîçTime : O(N*(2^N)) where N = 2n (because we have 2n places to fill and for each place we have max of 2 choices)
        Space : O(N)
