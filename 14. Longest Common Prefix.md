        explanation : 

                    ->// Main function

                        step 1 : create a 'ans' string to return at the end
                        step 2 : we need to traverse all characters of 1st string of arr
                            step 2.1 : we will pick each character of 1st string and save it in 'ch' , also we need to maintain a boolean 'isChPresentInAll = true' this boolean will be set to false whenever the ch is found absent in at least 1 of the strings   
                            
                            step 2.2 : now we have 'ch' so lets now check if this ch is present in all other strings of 'arr' or not 
                            for(int j=1; j < arr.size(); j++){
                                
                                step 2.2.1 : if the character ch is present in a string then keep going, else if the new words length is lesser then our i then break Or if ch is absent in any string then set boolean as false and then break from this loop ,
                            
                            step 2.3 : now once we get out of the above loop that means that either a character 'ch' was present in all of the strings if thats the case then save that character into the 'ans' or if the case is that character was not present in at least 1 of the strings then break out of the loop coz we have got our ans 
                        
                        step 3 : at last we return the ans string


        ✅T : O(n*m) - where n is length of largest word, m is total number of words in  array
        ✅S : O(1)

## ✔️Approach - 1 (iterative bruteforce approach) - java
```java
class Solution {
/*
  idea : pick the smallest string out of all, now pick each char of this str from start and check if it exists in the every other string or not, this way we find the longest common prefix
Time : O(2*(n*m))
Space : O(1)

*/
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        
        String LCP = "";
        String smallestStr = strs[0];

        for(int i=1; i < strs.length; i++) // find smallest str among all
            if(strs[i].length() < smallestStr.length())
                smallestStr = strs[i];

        
        for(int i=0; i < smallestStr.length(); i++){
            
            char ch = smallestStr.charAt(i); // fetch char and check if it is present in all the remaining strings or not
            boolean ansFound = false; 
            for(int j=0; j < strs.length; j++){
                String currStr = strs[j];
                if(currStr.charAt(i) == ch)
                    continue;
                else{
                    ansFound = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(ansFound) return LCP;
            else LCP += ch; // we found ch in all the strings so include it in the longest common prefix
        }
        
        return LCP;
    }
