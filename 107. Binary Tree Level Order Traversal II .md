    /* ✔️⭐Approach - 1 (using queue)

    idea : using 'null' to take care of each levels, 
            if front is null and q is empty then, means this is end of last level, so insert it and break loop
            if front is null and q is non empty that means, a level is complete so insert this level into 'ans' and insert null at end
            if front is non null, then insert it's data into 'currLevel' and its childs (if any) into q's end

            then reverse the 'ans' at end

        Time : O(n)
        Space : O(n) - queue
